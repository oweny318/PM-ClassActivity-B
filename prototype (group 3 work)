CODE Funcionality:
set every possible equation to it's own variable (e.x 1+15, 1+14, 1+13, etc.), check to see which ones equal to 15.
take all the possible sums that add to 15, and add them to an array, this way we can keep all of the needed equations in one spot
insert a print statement that will print out all of the variables in the array. 
insert a print statement that will print out the length of the array showing how many equations match the criteria.
