CODE Funcionality:
set every possible equation to it's own variable (e.x 1+15, 1+14, 1+13, etc.), check to see which ones equal to 15.
(likely int variables)

take all the possible sums that add to 15, and add them to an array, this way we can keep all of the needed equations in one spot
(array.add (variable name))

insert a print statement that will print out all of the variables in the array. 
(System.out.println (array);)

also insert a print statement that will print out how many equations there are in total.
(System.out.println (array.length);) (i can't remember the exact code off the top of my head :P)
